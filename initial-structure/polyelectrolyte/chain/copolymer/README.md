# Copolymer Initial Chain Conformations

This directory contains the initial chain conformations for the copolymers we study.
The copolymer chain names have an additional tag to distinguish their repeated block structure.
The naming convention is as follows:

```
i: ionized acrylate
n: neutral acrylate
a: acetate
c: alcohol
```

and refers to the side chain of the copolymer with an alkane backbone.
All chains are atactic.
